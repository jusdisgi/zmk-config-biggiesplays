# BiggieSplays ZMK Configuration

This repository contains a configuration for the [BiggieSplays](https://github.com/jusdisgi/BiggieSplays) keyboard to allow users to build firmware. This config leverages the zmk-keyboards-biggiesplays module for board/shield definitions; if you wish to look at or edit the shield you'll find that repo [here](https://github.com/jusdisgi/zmk-keyboards-biggiesplays) but you don't need it to use this config.

The default keymap could probably use some work. It's kind of a hodgepodge of cutting and pasting right now. Just trying to get something that builds, you should do your own keymap.

Have A Lot of Fun!
